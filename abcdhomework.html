        A paragraph f should consist of six  seven sentences. No, it should be no longer than three sentences long. Actually, it should include a topic sentence, several supporting sentences, and possibly a concluding sentence. ... The correct answer is that a paragraph has to be long enough to reach its end.

           <p>hey developed from their early lo-fi recordings. His abstract, autobiographical lyrics were his creative priority, and he extensively labored over them. Despite believing his work was unappreciated, Berman cultivated a passionate following and became an influential figure in indie rock. After he announced his withdrawal from music in 2009, his return to music in 2019, under the moniker Purple Mountains, prompted an enthusiastic response. His return to music closely preceded his death. Berman's life was marred by difficulties; his music and poetry showcase a forlorn quality, using varied characters in eccentric and surreal circumstances.</p>
